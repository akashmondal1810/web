I’m Lindsay, and this little website is my internet home. I write, I cook, and I take pictures of delicious food.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is my husband Bjork, and he&#8217;s in charge of the tech support and income stuff for Pinch of Yum. Plus he&#8217;s cute and I like him. Together we&#8217;re the Pinch of Yum and <a href="https://www.foodbloggerpro.com/" target="blank">Food Blogger Pro</a> team!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last five years teaching elementary schoolers by day and blogging about food by night, loving both jobs and never wanting to give either of them up. I always went back and forth about <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/on-full-time-blogging" target="_blank">becoming a full time blogger</a>, but in June 2014, I <a title="On Full Time Blogging: The End of a Chapter" href="https://pinchofyum.com/on-full-time-blogging-end-of-a-chapter" target="_blank">officially made the jump</a> and I couldn&#8217;t be more excited to be living this crazy work-for-yourself-and-talk-about-food-online dream.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2012 Bjork and I had the opportunity to live in the Philippines for a year where we worked and taught at an orphanage. This is the place where my three siblings lived before being adopted so it has always held extra special significance to us. <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/childrens-shelter-of-cebu" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s a page</a> with more information on the orphanage and the beautiful kids who call this place home. We ❤ CSC!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the cooking department, I&#8217;m a food enthusiast with an appetite for almost anything. I love to cook vegetarian dishes, but we&#8217;re not strictly anything when it comes to what we eat. I love desserts, especially straight up salted dark chocolate. I try to cook things that are practical, interesting, and delicious. I adore noodles, curry, lentils, and pasta. Is that the same as noodles? Doesn&#8217;t matter. I love it all.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite things in life are <a title="Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies" href="https://pinchofyum.com/perfect-chocolate-chip-cookies" target="_blank">chocolate chip cookies</a>, Mexican food, our sweet baby girl <a title="Introducing Sage" href="https://pinchofyum.com/introducing-sage" target="_blank">Sage</a>, the Philippines, lake runs in the fall, and sunsets.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, I&#8217;m constantly trying to learn how to be better at things that really matter, like living intentionally, appreciating people, and following Jesus.</p>
